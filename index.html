    <p>Here are some projects I worked on so far at Epicodus!</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I worked in customer service for every job I've had so far. I've sold board games at a game store, food and sandwiches in a deli, and now bagels at a bagel and breakfast place. It has gotten pretty boring doing the same thing over and over, which is why I applied at <strong>epicodus</strong>. I want to learn a larger variety of things, not just how to help customers. I learned of Epicodus through a friend of mine whose dad mentioned it. I took a workshop and enjoyed the learning style quite a bit. Now I'm here and looking forward to all I learn.</p>
      <p>I <em>really</em> enjoy competetive games. I don't particularly care of what veriety, I'll play whatever as long as there is fair competition. Some of my favorites are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span id = "brawl">Brawlhalla</span>, a fighting game</li>
        <li>Magic: The Gathering, a card game</li>
        <li>Dominion, a deck-building board game</li>
      </ol>
